Battleship README

 1: Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
 # We didn't have an interaction pattern so we read through the iteration and pretty much used the bullet points of the iteration as a guide. We made our Game class and created the menu, then concentrated on setup, then turns, then endgame.

 2: If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
 # We would have done quite a bit -- certainly more refactoring of methods and tests, we had some bugs we wanted to work out, namely getting our game to properly start a new game with a wiped board. 

 3: Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
 # We did a modified ping-pong method. We worked together-- nearly all our work was seen or coded in real time with both coders together. But one person wrote a section while the other gave input, then switched roles.

 4: Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
 # Feedback was shared in real time but refactoring comments were given before merges.
